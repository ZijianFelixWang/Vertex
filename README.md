## What it is
*Vertex* is a two-dimensional cellular automata simulator which can evolve itself with genetic algorithms to achieve certain goals (from which I learnt a lot about probability and 
combinatorics). I completed it in middle school. It is now made public.

This is inspired by A New Kind of Science.
